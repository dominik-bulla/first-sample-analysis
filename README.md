# first-sample-analysis
First sample repository with excerpts to highlight some of my quantitative/ coding skills.

Background: The client was interested to explore the relations between achievement of programmatic targets (i.e., yes/ no) and 
top-level factors associated with operations across the world. To answer the question, a multilevel-regression analysis 
was performed. Impact targets refer to two units (i.e., GBV as well as CBP) within the organization. There are also two types 
of targets, i.e., impact as well as performance (output) targets. The example analysis below is only about GBV impact targets. 
The other three analyses are not presented here.
