# first-sample-analysis
First sample repository with excerpts to highlight some of my quantitative/ coding skills.

Background: The client was interested to explore the relations between achievement of programmatic targets (i.e., yes/ no) and 
top-level factors associated with operations across the world. To answer the question, a multilevel-regression analysis 
was performed. Impact targets refer to two units (i.e., GBV as well as CBP) within the organization. There are also two types 
of targets, i.e., impact as well as performance (output) targets. The example analysis below is only about GBV impact targets. 
The other three analyses are not presented here.    

The entire project consists of the following folders:
01 raw data, which contains raw data pulled into the project. Note, some relevant data may be pulled from other sources using API's.
02 processed data, which contains data manipulated during project work. 
03 scripts, which contains all R scripts to load, clean, and analyse data. The sequence in which to run the files are clearly indicated within the script names.
04 results, which contains all analysis output files such as tables and graphs produced during the analysis. 
05 documentation, which contains the reports that present the analysis results and findings.

The entire project is managed in RStudio. To review and edit the project, open the Rproj-file 'first-sample-analysis', which is located at the top-level of the repository. It opens up the two R-scripts, which are placed in the folder '03 scripts'.
